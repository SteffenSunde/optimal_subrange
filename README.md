Totally bikeshedding the process of choosing a subset of 
steps outputted from the finite element software *Abaqus*.

The problem consists of choosing k numbers of a given list, maximising spread. This can be translated into maximising the minimum distance between the points in the output. 

This is a good case for dynamic programming!
